### INSIGHT
---
##### 1. TOP 10 SUB-CATEGORY BY QUANTITY
  
- The data shows high demand for office essentials like binders and paper, which lead in sales quantity. There's also notable interest in office infrastructure items like furnishings, phones, and storage, indicating a balance between consumable supplies and durable goods. The popularity of art and accessories suggests a trend toward workplace personalization. Lower sales for items like chairs and appliances reflect their durable nature. Labels, while niche, show steady demand for organizational tools. Overall, the business caters to a broad range of office needs, balancing everyday consumables with long-term investments.

##### 2. TOP 5 PRODUCTS BY CATEGORY

- The firm's revenue is heavily concentrated in its top three products—Staple Envelop, Easy Staple Paper, and Staple—which together account for 79% of the take. This suggests the firm is reliant on a few key products.


#### 3. PROFIT BY REGION

- The firm's profits are concentrated in the West and East, with the West leading at $108,418 and the East generating $91,522. The South ($46,749) and Central ($39,706) regions lag behind, indicating potential challenges or untapped opportunities in these areas

#### 4. SALES BY REGION

- Sales are concentrated in the West (32%) and East (29%), making them the firm's strongest regions. The Central (22%) region has a moderate share, while the South (17%) is the weakest in terms of sales, indicating potential challenges in market penetration.

#### 5. TOP 10 CUSTOMERS DISCOUNT

- The bottom five sales representatives have relatively close sales figures, but Jessica Smith has the lowest performance at $50,206. 

#### 7. SALES TREND

- After a sales decline in 2015, the firm experienced strong growth in 2016 and 2017, with sales reaching their highest in 2017. The upward trend suggests effective strategies were implemented following 2015, leading to significant improvements.

#### 8. TOP 5 MOST EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS

- The top five most expensive products are dominated by Staple Envelop (27%) and Easy-Staple Paper and Staples (26% each). Avery Non-Stick Binders (11%) and Staples in Misc. Colors (10%) have smaller shares. Focusing on managing and optimizing the top products will be crucial for maximizing profitability.

### RECOMMENDATION

#### 1. TOP 10 SUB-CATEGORIES BY QUANTITY

- My recommendation is to focus on maintaining strong inventory for high-demand consumables like binders and paper, while also exploring opportunities to boost margins in other categories, and re-strategize to increase their turnover

#### 2. TOP 5 PRODUCTS BY CATEGORY

- Focus on maintaining the strong performance of the top products while exploring ways to boost sales for lower-performing items that couldn’t make it to the Top 5. Diversifying product success can reduce risk and drive overall growth.

#### 3. PROFIT BY REGION

- Prioritize maintaining and expanding the strong performance in the West and East regions. Investigate the South and Central regions to identify challenges or opportunities for growth, and implement strategies to boost profitability in these underperforming areas.

#### 4. SALES BY REGION

- The sales distribution across regions shows that the West (32%) and East (29%) dominate the firm’s sales, contributing a combined total of 61%. This aligns with the earlier observation of high profits in these regions, indicating strong market presence and customer demand.
- 

#### 5. TOP 10 CUSTOMERS DISCOUNTS

- Evaluate the impact of high discounts on profitability and sales volume. Consider whether these discounts are justified by the returns in customer retention and revenue, and adjust discount strategies as needed to balance customer incentives with profitability.

#### 6. BOTTOM 5 SALES BY REP

- There are opportunities for improvement, particularly for everyone within this group. Analyze the sales strategies of the lower-performing representatives and provide targeted training or support to help improve their performance.

  #### 7. SALES TREND

  - Build on the successful strategies from 2016 and 2017 to sustain and further enhance growth. Analyze what contributed to the rebound and continued success, and apply those insights to maintain momentum and address any potential challenges. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772e0f91-78ad-4e18-a4c7-704cd1c7ff05)
